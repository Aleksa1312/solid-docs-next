To maintain consistency across an application's page you can use layouts. 
Layouts are components that wrap the content of a route and can be used to define a common structure for all pages or specific sections of an application.


## Root-level layouts

A root-level layout acts as a container surrounding all routes within your application._createMdxContentTo define a route-level layout, pass the layout component to the `root` prop of the `Router` component:

```jsx
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import { Router, Route } from "@solidjs/router";

import Home from "./pages/Home";

const Layout = (props) => {
    return (
        <>
            <header>Header</header>
            {props.children}
            <footer>Footer</footer>
        </>
    );
};

render(
    () => (
        <Router root={Layout}>
            <Route path="/" component={Home} />
            <Route path="/hello-world" component={<div>Hello world!</div>} />

        </Router>
    ),
    document.getElementById("app")
);
```

With the root-level layout, the `props,children` within the layout component will be replaced with the content of current route.
This means that while the words "Header" and "Footer" will be displayed on every page, the content between them will change depending on the current route.
For example, when the route is `/hello-world`, you will see the text "Hello world!" between the header and footer.

## Nested layouts

Nested layouts create a hierarchy structure for layouts.
Routes can be nested within each other to apply different layouts to different sections of an application.

```jsx
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import { Router, Route } from "@solidjs/router";

import Home from "./pages/Home";

const Layout = (props) => {
    return (
        <>
            <header>Header</header>
            {props.children}
            <footer>Footer</footer>
        </>
    );
};

const NestedLayout = (props) => {
    return (
        <>
            <nav>Navigation</nav>
            {props.children}
        </>
    );
};

render(
    () => (
        <Router root={Layout}>
            <Route path="/" component={Home} />
            <Route path="/nested" root={NestedLayout}>
                <Route path="/" component={<div>Nested Home</div>} />
                <Route path="/nested/hello-world" component={<div>Nested Hello world!</div>} />
            </Route>
        </Router>
    ),
    document.getElementById("app")
);
```

In leveraging nested layouts, the UI structure of the application can be broken down into smaller, more manageable sections.
In the example above, the `NestedLayout` component is used to wrap the content of the `/nested` route.
This means that the `NestedLayout` component will be rendered when the route is `/nested` or any of its children.
